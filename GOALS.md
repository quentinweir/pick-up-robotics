# Motivation

- Do something fun and exciting in the off-season
- Learn by doing: students lead, design, build and organize
- Reduce time commitment and stress on mentors

# Priorities

1. Safe enough to run in a public, open space (e.g. basketball or tennis court)
1. Completely student run (inspired by OCCRA and Ultimate Frisbee)
1. Inexpensive (both money and time) for an FRC team to try
1. Flexible matches for any number of teams: 1v1, 1v1v1, 2v2, 3v3
1. Quick setup with minimal field requirements and very low risk of field damage
1. Minimal transportation requirements: both field and robot must fit into a car
1. Authentic FRC design, build and driving experience
1. Simple rules and scoring without the need of referees
1. Handicapping system allowing a large range of experience levels to compete
1. Enjoyable to play year over year without rules changes (balanced roles without a dominant strategy)
1. Elo style rating system for league play

2. Provide enough support/simplicity that an experienced team could be up and running in <8 hours
3. Have clear roles for drivetrain-only bots
